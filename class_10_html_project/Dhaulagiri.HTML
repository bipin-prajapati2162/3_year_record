The Dhaulagiri massif in Nepal extends 120 km (70 mi) from the Kaligandaki River west to the Bheri. This massif is bounded on the north and southwest by tributaries of the Bheri River and on the southeast by the Myagdi Khola. Dhaulagiri I is the seventh highest mountain in the world at 8,167 metres (26,795 ft) above sea level, and the highest mountain within the borders of a single country (Nepal). It was first climbed on 13 May 1960 by a Swiss/Austrian/Nepali expedition. 
The mountain's name is (dhaulagiri) in Nepali. This comes from Sanskrit where (dhawala) means dazzling, white, beautiful and giri means mountain.4[4] Dhaulagiri I is also the highest point of the Gandaki river basin.
